## About

A take-home challenge for an apprenticeship opportunity with Soon_. I chose User Flow 2: updating the basket. 
## Technologies used
I've chosen to do this in React with typescript. Firstly because they are technologies I know Soon_ uses. And more importantly, because I'm done with trying to manipulate the DOM with Vanilla JS. 

Meta take the wheel!

## Assumptions
I'm assuming that:
- I'll need to follow the design as closely as possible and use the exact colors, fonts and assets in the page.
- The design will none-the-less need to be responsive, so I'll need a layout that's suitable for mobile devices but follows the same design principles.
- The components I make will need to be reusable, so the data must be passed using props.
- While in a real-world environment the product details will come from a server via a fetch function, I don't have to implement that in this challenge.

# Process

1. I'll first create a static version of the page, following the style closely and taking a mobile-first approach.
2. Then I'll use the State Hook, so that the buttons update the DOM.
3. Next, I'll use props to pass in the data for the page.
4. Finally, I'll test for accessibility and include aria roles/attributes where necessary.
